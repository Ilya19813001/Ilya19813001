### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**My name is Ilya Kim**

In March 2023, I successfully completed the "Data analyst" courses from Yandex.Practicum. I am currently looking for a job in the field of data analytics. I also constantly study the material covered and read new articles by professional data analysts.  I am interested in applying the knowledge gained in practice. I want to benefit the organization in which I will work.
